      <h1> <p style="text-align:center;">About Me </p> </h1>
      <p style="text-align:center;" >This piece is my first time combining my skills in JavaScript, Html, and CSS, which I am very proud of. I created a round man that gives out a random yelp, grunt, or scream when he is clicked on or "punched." In addition to this, I added styling for the text and layout, a custom volume slider, and the ability to head over to my artist statement that you're reading now. Overall, I am very satisfied with how this project came out, and the only things I would add would be more sounds, and a custom cursor shaped like a fist to really emphasize the "punching" aspect of the website.</p>
